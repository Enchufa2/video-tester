Short-term:
* Use RTSP session instead of ping (PSH-ACK pairs)
* video: fix h264 and theora readers
* Check for compatibility issues with other libraries
* Fix scripts generate-conf.py and series.py
* Fix setup.py
* Update dependencies
* Update docs
* New stable release

Long-term:
* Fix udp-mcast or drop support
* Move from Scapy to a more efficient solution. Maybe implement the networking part (packet capturing and processing) in a dedicated C library with Python bindings
* Add unit tests
* Integrate with Travis / Coveralls
* Move to Python3
* Parallelization
* Refactor... always refactor

Long-long-term:
* Online assessment?
