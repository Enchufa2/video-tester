Short-term:
* Fix packet parser.
* Retrieve session information (negotiated video stream ports, etc.) from GStreamer.
* Fix known compatibility issues with the latest versions of GStreamer (H.263?).
* Check for compatibility issues with other libraries.
* import numpy as np
* Set log level via command-line.
* Fix scripts generate-conf.py and series.py
* Fix setup.py

Long-term:
* Move from Scapy to a more efficient solution. Maybe implement the networking part (packet capturing and processing) in a dedicated C library with Python bindings.
* Parallelization.
* Refactor... always refactor.

Long-long-term:
* Online assessment?
