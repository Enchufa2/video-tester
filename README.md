# Video Tester - Video Quality Assessment Tool

Video Tester is a framework for video quality assessment over a real or simulated IP network. Parameter extraction is performed on the three levels involved in the video processing and transmission ---packet level, bitstream level and picture level--- in order to gather as much information as possible. Therefore, it is suitable for implementing any kind of metric: data metrics, picture metrics, packet-based metrics, bitstream-based metrics or hybrid metrics; with full-reference, reduced-reference or no-reference.

It is a Linux application programmed in Python with the aim of promoting extensibility, and the election of the GStreamer framework for video processing is due to its broad support in this area. Video Tester covers [EvalVid](http://www.tkn.tu-berlin.de/research/evalvid/) features and adds further improvements in terms of usability, extensibility, codec support, support of transmission methods and reliability in case of losses.

## Features

- Codec support: H.263, H.264, MPEG-4 part 2, Theora.
- Implemented metrics:
    - QoS metrics: latency, delta, jitter, skew, bandwidth, packet loss rate, packet loss distribution.
    - Bitstream metrics: stream eye, reference stream eye, gop size, I-frame loss rate.
    - Video quality metrics: PSNR, SSIM, ITU-T G.1070, MOS (PSNR to MOS mapping from EvalVid), MIV (from EvalVid).

## Installation

Video Tester has the following dependencies:

- Python 2.7.
- GStreamer (>=1.0) + plugins: base, good, ugly, bad, libav.
- GStreamer RTSP server (>=1.0).
- PyGObject (>=3.18.2).
- Pylibpcap (>=0.6.4).
- Numpy (>=1.4.1).
- OpenCV (>=2.1) with Python bindings.
- Matplotlib (>=1.0.1).
- WxPython (>=2.8.11) + Matplotlib backend.

### Method 1 (RPM-based):

If you are using **Fedora**/**Cent OS**, you can build an RPM and let `dnf` manage all dependencies for you. First of all, enable the [RPM Fusion](http://rpmfusion.org) repositories. Then, you can download the latest RPM, if available, or build it by yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Enchufa2/video-tester.git
cd video-tester
make bdist_rpm
cd dist
```

and then install it:

```bash
sudo dnf install VideoTester-x.x.x-1.noarch.rpm
```

### Method 2 (all distros):

First, manually install all the required dependencies.

- For **Fedora**/**Cent OS** (tested on Fedora 26 with [RPM Fusion](http://rpmfusion.org) enabled):

```bash
sudo dnf install \
    gstreamer1 \
    gstreamer1-libav \
    gstreamer1-plugins-base \
    gstreamer1-plugins-good \
    gstreamer1-plugins-ugly \
    gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free \
    gstreamer1-plugins-bad-freeworld \
    gstreamer1-rtsp-server \
    python-gobject \
    pylibpcap \
    numpy \
    opencv-python \
    python2-matplotlib \
    python2-matplotlib-wx \
    wxPython
```

- For **Ubuntu**/**Debian** (tested on Ubuntu 18.04):

```bash
sudo apt-get install \
    gstreamer1.0-libav \
    gstreamer1.0-plugins-base \
    gstreamer1.0-plugins-good \
    gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly \
    gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad \
    gstreamer1.0-tools \
    gstreamer1.0-x \
    gstreamer1.0-alsa \
    gstreamer1.0-gl \
    gstreamer1.0-gtk3 \
    gstreamer1.0-qt5 \
    gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio \
    gstreamer1.0-rtsp \
    gir1.2-gst-rtsp-server-1.0 \
    python-gobject \
    python-libpcap \
    python-numpy \
    python-opencv \
    python-matplotlib \
    python-wxmpl \
    python-wxgtk3.0
```

Then, download the latest version of Video Tester and follow these steps:

```bash
tar xf VideoTester-x.x.x.tar.gz
cd VideoTester-x.x.x
sudo python setup.py install
```

## Basic Usage

VT in server mode:

```bash
VT server
```

VT in client mode:

```bash
VT client
```

How to specify another configuration file (by default, Video Tester looks for a `VT.conf` file in the current working directory):

```bash
VT -c path/to/another.conf [server|client]
```

VT in client mode with GUI:

```bash
VT client -g
```
